### (Chapter1_Challenge_1_44)

## üìò Description
**Config File Loader** is a Java console program that demonstrates **file handling** and **exception management**.  
It reads a configuration file (`config.txt`), validates its contents, and checks whether a specified file path exists.  

The program covers multiple types of exceptions including:
- File not found  
- Invalid number format  
- Input/output errors  
- Custom exceptions for business logic

---

## üß© Features
- Reads a configuration file line by line using `BufferedReader`.  
- Parses the **version number** and checks for compatibility.  
- Reads a **file path** from the config and verifies its existence.  
- Handles multiple exceptions gracefully:
  - `FileNotFoundException`  
  - `NumberFormatException`  
  - `IOException`  
  - General `Exception`  
- Ensures cleanup and final message using `finally` block.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or later  
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., **VS Code**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, **NetBeans**, **Eclipse**)  
- A configuration file named `config.txt` in the project directory
